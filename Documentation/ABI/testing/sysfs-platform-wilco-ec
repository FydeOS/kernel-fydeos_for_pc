Date:          October 2019
KernelVersion: 5.5
Description:
               Control the USB PowerShare Policy. USB PowerShare is a policy
               which affects charging via the special USB PowerShare port
               (marked with a small lightning bolt or battery icon) when in
               low power states:
               - In S0, the port will always provide power.
               - In S0ix, if usb_charge is enabled, then power will be
                 supplied to the port when on AC or if battery is > 50%.
                 Else no power is supplied.
               - In S5, if usb_charge is enabled, then power will be supplied
                 to the port when on AC. Else no power is supplied.

               Input should be either "0" or "1".

Description:
               Display Wilco Embedded Controller firmware version.
               The format of the string is x.y.z. Where x is major, y is minor
               and z is the build number. For example: 95.00.06

What:          /sys/bus/platform/devices/GOOG000C\:00/wilco-charge-schedule/advanced_charging/enable
Date:          May 2019
KernelVersion: 5.3
Description:
		Enable/disable the Advanced Charging policy.

		Advanced Charging Mode maximizes the battery health by adjusting
		the charging algorithm throughout the day. When enabled, the
		system will use standard charging algorithms and other
		techniques during non-work hours to maximize battery health.
		During work hours, an express charge is used, allowing the
		battery to be charged faster. For each day the time in which the
		system will be most heavily used is specified by the start time
		and the duration.

		The input must be parseable by strtobool() from linux/string.h.
		The output is either "0\n" or "1\n".

What:          /sys/bus/platform/devices/GOOG000C\:00/wilco-charge-schedule/advanced_charging/{sunday,monday,...}
Date:          May 2019
KernelVersion: 5.3
Description:
		Get or set the Advanced Charging schedule for a day of the week.

		The input and output string have the format
		"start_hr:start_min duration_hr:duration_min". The hour fields
		are in the range [0-23], and the minutes are one of
		{0, 15, 30, 45}.

		For writing, the input string must be parseable by sscanf()
		using the format string "%d:%d %d:%d". An example valid input is
		"0006:15 23:45". When reading, the schedule is formatted with
		"%02d:%02d %02d:%02d\n". An example output is "06:15 23:45\n".

Date:          May 2019
KernelVersion: 5.3
Description:
		Enable/disable the Peak Shift power management policy.

		Peak Shift is power saving policy that minimizes AC usage during
		the peak usage times of the day. For each weekday a start, end,
		and charge_start time to run in Peak Shift mode can be set.
		After the start time the system will run from the battery even
		if the AC is attached, as long as the battery stays above a
		specified threshold. After the end time the system will run from
		AC (if attached) but will not charge the battery. The system
		will again function normally (use AC and recharge the battery)
		after the charge_start time.

		The input must be parseable by strtobool() from linux/string.h.
		The output is either "0\n" or "1\n".
