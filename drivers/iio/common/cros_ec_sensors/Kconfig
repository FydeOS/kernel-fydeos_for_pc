	  Base module for the ChromeOS EC Sensors module.
	  Contains core functions used by other IIO CrosEC sensor
	  drivers.
	  Define common attributes and sysfs interrupt handler.

config IIO_CROS_EC_SENSORS
	tristate "ChromeOS EC Contiguous Sensors"
	depends on IIO_CROS_EC_SENSORS_CORE
	help
	  Module to handle 3d contiguous sensors like
	  Accelerometers, Gyroscope and Magnetometer that are
	  presented by the ChromeOS EC Sensor hub.
	  Creates an IIO device for each functions.

config IIO_CROS_EC_SENSORS_LID_ANGLE
	tristate "ChromeOS EC Sensor for lid angle"
	depends on IIO_CROS_EC_SENSORS_CORE
	help
	  Module to report the angle between lid and base for some
	  convertible devices.
	  This module is loaded when the EC can calculate the angle between the base
	  and the lid.

config IIO_CROS_EC_ACTIVITY
	tristate "ChromeOS EC Activity Sensors"
	depends on IIO_CROS_EC_SENSORS_CORE
	help
	  Module to handle activity events detections presented by the ChromeOS
	  EC Sensor hub.
	  Activities can be simple (low/no motion) or more complex (riding train).
	  They are being reported by physical devices or the EC itself.
	  Creates an IIO device to manage all activities.

	depends on MFD_CROS_EC_DEV
	help
	  Add support for handling sensor events FIFO produced by
	  the sensor hub.
	  A single device with a buffer will collect all samples produced
	  by the sensors managed by the CroEC sensor hub.

config IIO_CROS_EC_SENSORS_SYNC
	tristate "ChromeOS EC Counter Sensors"
	depends on IIO_CROS_EC_SENSORS_CORE
	help
	  Module to handle synchronisation sensors presented by the ChromeOS EC
	  Sensor hub.
	  Synchronisation sensors are counter sensors that are triggered when
	  events occurs from other subsystems. They are use to synchronised
	  those subsystem with existing MEMS sensors, like gyroscope.
